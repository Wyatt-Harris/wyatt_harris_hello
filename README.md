I completed all 3 levels: core competency, skill expansion, and professional quality.  
AI Use:  
Level 1:  
I used the Copilot extension in VS Code to aid me throughout most of the project. It ended up being extremely valuable in not only helping me complete the assignment, but also 
helping me get back in the swing of things with Java and programming in general. Nothing in the first level was really incorrect because it was all copied and pasted from the 
assignment, but when I was confused why my first commit wasn't getting pushed to GitHub, I was able to ask, and it worked perfectly. Another extremely helpful tool was the autocomplete 
function. I really don't like using AI if I don't know what's going on/ why it is working, but the auto-complete on certain simple lines like "println" lines makes it so easy to avoid simple
syntax mistakes. When it comes to changes that I made on the first level I just changed the name from Jason to Wyatt but that becomes irrelevant by the third level when the name is decided by whatever the 
scanner object picks up.  
Level 2:  
AI Prompt: "how would I overload greet to allow a custom message?"  
AI Response: "You can overload the greet method by adding a new method with the same name but a different parameter list. For example, add a greet(String message)"  
Admittedly I should have remembered how to do this, but I forgot exactly what overloading meant.  
Level 3:  
The AI did not get anything noticeably wrong in the debugging process and actually helped me quite a bit like when it suggested to use a try block for the instantiation of the scanner object so a 
closing statement would not be neccesary. One thing the AI did get wrong was I asked it to generate me an ASCII art splash of a spider and it gave me one of a cat instead. I do not mind this change 
so I kept it as a cat. I would probably use something like this code in a real-world app because the idea of creating people objects probably becomes very valuable when the methods have more purpose than
greet or introduce.
